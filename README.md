## 📌 About the Project

**ArtistsHub** is a platform for discovering musical artists.  
Users can browse a list of performers and open a modal window with detailed
information about each artist, including a description, music style, song list,
and more. The platform also allows users to read feedback and reviews from other
listeners.

The project aims to provide a convenient and user-friendly way to explore
artists in one place.
