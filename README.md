## 📌 About the Project

**ArtistsHub** is a platform for discovering musical artists. Users can explore
a curated list of performers and access detailed information about each artist
through a modal window, including a biography, music style, song catalog, and
more. The platform also features user feedback and reviews, allowing listeners
to gain insights from the community.

The project is designed to offer a seamless and intuitive experience for
discovering and exploring artists in a single, convenient place.
